           <div class="about-content">
           <p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic throws spotlight on global wildlife and is having substantial impact on animals across the globe. We, being the responsible citizens, need to conserve the wildlife to maintain species diversity and for proper functioning of a healthy ecosystem. The number of endangered species has dramatically risen over time. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while in 1998, 1102 animals and 1197 plants have been categorized as endangered, this number increased to 3079 animals and 2655 plants until 2012 including Olive ridley turtle, Red Panda, South Asian River Dolphin . The major reason for the destruction of habitats include changes in natural living conditions, hunting, fishing, pollution, insufficient reproduction rate, conflicts between wildlife and humans. But due to ongoing pandemic since the human trafficking and proliferation of tourism industries  have become minimal therefore the endangered species needs special attention of conseravation.</p>

                        Olive Ridley Sea Turtle, also known as Lepidochelys olivacea has a circumtropical distribution, living in tropical and warm waters of the Indian Ocean.
                      </li> 
                      <li>
                        In the Indian Ocean, three arribada beaches occur in Odisha, India - Gahirmatha, Devi River mouth, and Rushikulya—with an estimated  100,000 nests per year. More recently, a new mass nesting site was discovered in the Andaman islands, India, with more than 5,000 nests reported in a season
                     </li> 
                      <li>
                         These turtles are considered endangered because they nest in a very small number of places, and therefore any disturbance to even one nest beach could have huge repercussions on the entire population.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List, there has been between a 30 to 50 percent reduction in global population size. Although some nesting populations have increased in the past few years or are currently stable but the overall reduction is greater than the overall increase in other populations.

                      <li>
                        Harvest of eggs and killing of adults is the principal cause of the historical, worldwide decline is long-term collection of eggs and killing of adults on nesting beaches. The arribada nesting behavior concentrates females and nests at the same time and in the same place, allowing for mass killing of adult females, as well as the taking of an extraordinary number of eggs.

              <p>•	The incubation temperature seems to exhibit a tonic effect on embryo mortality and development on the high end of the TTR given that it is the time spent at high temperatures and above 35°C that determines embryo arrest and death and not the mere fact of reaching this temperature.</p>
              <p>•	This indicates that embryos have physiological mechanisms that allow them to withstand exceedingly high temperatures, and that these mechanisms will fail if temperatures do not decrease below the lethal limit.</p>
              <p>•	The cooling period (rain) may rescue embryos at risk of overheating. This observation supports the idea of developing artificial ways to cool down incubating nests during the dry months by providing them with irrigation or shading  to increase hatchling production during those months</p>

               <div class="about-content">
                   <p>The Red Panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a mammal species native to the eastern Himalayas in India. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List because the wild population is estimated at fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and continues to decline .Red pandas are the only animal representative of its family, the Ailuridae. It is important as it is part of the world’s natural heritage and contributes to the planet’s diversity. The Red pandas are part of the ecosystem within the Eastern Himalayan Broadleaf Forest. Conservation biologists use red pandas presence as an indicator of the overall health of the ecoregion. Thus protecting their habitats also protects other threatened animals like Himalayan black bears, clouded leopards, and many bird species.They help balance the ecosystem. Like all wild animals, red pandas have their own predators. Their extinction would affect the survival of the predators that rely on them for their survival. Furthermore, Red pandas keep bamboos in control by feeding on them. If they get extinct, the bamboo plants can grow out of control, affecting the growth of other plants in the forest.</p>

           <h2 id="about-usss-h2">Why are the Red Pandas Endangered?</h2>
               <div class="about-content">
                  <ul>
                   
                      <li>
                        Deforestation:-The loss of habitat is one of the reasons why the red pandas’ population is declining. Altering the nature of forests can also lead to the separation of different groups of red pandas resulting in inbreeding. Inbreeding leads to less genetic diversity making animals unable to survive in their natural environments.
                      </li> 
                      <li>
                        Poaching is another major reason the numbers of red pandas are quickly declining in forests.The bright, reddish fur and striped tails also make red pandas a prime target for poachers looking to sell their pelts for profit.
                     </li> 
                      <li>
                         Accidental Trapping by humans living close to the natural habitats of red pandas also endanger the survival of the animals. Red pandas can be accidentally trapped in traps meant to trap other animals, and once trapped, they are never released back into the forest and are sold into the black market.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      Red pandas, however, have failed to adapt to the changing environment. Their digestive system cannot properly digest anything else other than the bamboo shoots and leaves, which means they can only thrive in environments they were originally adapted to live.So from the observation from given below we can estimate and understand the effect of these lockdown on thse species.  Lack of pollution and increased vegetation helps the Red Panda in their natural mating.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      Red pandas are highly selective when choosing their mate. Their selective nature does not guarantee putting two pairs together in captivity will mate, which makes it difficult for breeding programs.

To combat this, we are trying to protect the red panda's natural habitat. The largest conservation effort is focused on surveying the land and finding unprotected areas that have red panda populations. By creating safe environments for the red pandas to live in, we hope that red pandas will begin to reproduce and thrive more. Moreover, environmental efforts are being made to educate people and make them more aware of the plight of red pandas for more support for conservation and protected regions. </p>

The Ganges river dolphin is primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and their tributaries in India while the Indus river dolphin is now found only in the main channel of the River Beas (a tributary of the Indus) in Punjab in India. A 2017 population assessment estimated less than 5,000 individuals for the species as a whole, of which about 3,500 belong to the Ganges subspecies and about 1,500 to the Indus subspecies.They have also been classified as endangered since the 1970s. Their current population is estimated at only several hundred dolphins, a number unlikely to sustain the species, and one that will create genetic problems.South Asian river dolphins are rated by IUCN as Endangered due not only to the huge reduction in their overall numbers, but also the ongoing shrinking of their habitats and freshwater places they are able to live.</p>

                        	The various water development projects such as dams and irrigation barrages have dramatically affected the abundance and population structure of this species that isolate dolphins into small sections of river, fragmenting the population and have degraded downstream habitat and created impoundments with high sedimentation and altered assemblages of fish and invertebrate species.

                      <li>
                       Pollutant loads in rivers are increasing and can be expected to continue to do so with industrialization and the spread of intensive agricultural practices facilitated by irrigation with river water. The capacity of these rivers to dilute pollutants (e.g., arsenic,DDT, industrial effluents) and salinity has already been drastically reduced because of upstream water abstraction, diversion, and impoundment.

                      <li>
                       The deliberate killing of river dolphins  by tribal people in the upper Brahmaputra for their meat and by fishermen in the middle reaches of the Ganges for their oil, which is used as a fish attractant.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                     Mortality in fishing gear, especially gillnets, is a severe problem for Ganges Dolphins throughout most of their range and is an increasing problem for Indus Dolphins. They are particularly vulnerable because their preferred habitat is often in the same location as the fishing grounds.

                   <p>Since due to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic, human interference in waterbodies have dropped down. Therefore, contamination by harmful pollutants have been stopped. Therefore, the abundancy rate of this species have risen up.</p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
           <p>Wildlife is a precious gift of God to the planet. India has a wide range of biodiversity around 2,50,000 species due to its geographical distribution. An ever expanding human population, rapid urbanization and industrialisation, pollution and climate change leads to habitat loss, food shortage and a number of other consequences forcing the wildlife towards getting endangered. Species or habitat conservation is the immediate necessity to maintain environmental balance. We aim to protect endangered species like Olive Riddley Turtle, South Asian Dolphin and Red Pandas.Since, this year for complete lockdown due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic human trafficking has dropped, major air pollutants like PM 2.5 and PM 10 HAS REDUCED BY 50%-52%, discharge of effluents and contamination of waterbodies have been stopped therefore a change in behavior of these endangered species has been observed. The millions of Olive Riddley sea turtle are seen to hatch eggs in empty sea beaches whereas usually they used to hatch during the month of late spring. This year, 3,23,063 Olive Ridley turtles had nested at the Rushikulya rookery. Nesting sea turtles provide important nutrition to the beach ecosystem. The unhatched eggs and trapped hatchlings are excellent sources of nutrients for the vegetation in the sandy ecosystem which play a vital role in dune vegetation. Dolphins are top-level predators in the ocean food chain and they act as a bio-indicator, according to The Institute of Marine Mammal Studies. Study and monitoring of dolphins help us to find out if something is wrong with their ocean environment. Conservation of Red Panda is equally important as it involves part of the world’s natural heritage. Their presence acts as an indicator of the overall health of the eco region. Thus protecting their habitats also protects other threatened animals like Himalayan black bears, clouded leopards, and many bird species.</p>
